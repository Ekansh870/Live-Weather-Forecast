**Live Weather Forecast Powerbi Dashboard :**

An interactive Power BI dashboard built using a Weather API to visualize current weather conditions and 7-day forecasts. The dashboard helps analyze key weather parameters 
with dynamic visuals, providing real-time insights for better decision-making.

**Features :**
```
1. Current Weather Tracking – Temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and pressure.
2. 7-Day Forecast – Daily temperature trends, chance of rain, and precipitation levels.
3. Sunrise & Sunset Timings – Real-time updates based on location.
4. Air Quality Index (AQI) – Includes PM2.5, PM10, SO2, O3, CO, and NO2 readings.
5. Dynamic Visualizations – Interactive charts and cards for weather analysis.
```
**Tools & Technologies :**
```
1. Power BI – Data visualization & dashboard creation
2. Weather API – For fetching real-time and forecast weather data
3. Data Transformation (ETL) – Cleaning and structuring data for analysis
```
